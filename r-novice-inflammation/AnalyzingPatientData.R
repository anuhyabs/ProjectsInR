# Note that R may return an error when you attempt to perform similar
# calculations on subsetted rows of data frames. This is because some 
# functions in R automatically convert the object type to a numeric
# vector, while others do not (e.g. max(dat[1, ]) works as expected, 
# while mean(dat[1, ]) returns NA and a warning). You get the expected
# output by including an explicit call to as.numeric(), 
# e.g. mean(as.numeric(dat[1, ])). By contrast, calculations on 
# subsetted columns always work as expected, since columns of 
# data frames are already defined as vectors.

#  1. Write a vector containing each affected patient (hint: ?seq)

# Challenge: the apply function can be used to summarize datasets and subsets
# of data across rows and columns using the MARGIN argument. Suppose you want 
# to calculate the mean inflammation for specific days and patients in the 
# patient dataset (i.e. 60 patients across 40 days).
# 
# Please use a combination of the apply function and indexing to:
#   
# 1. calculate the mean inflammation for patients 1 to 5 over the whole 40 days
# 2. calculate the mean inflammation for days 1 to 10 (across all patients).
# 3. calculate the mean inflammation for every second day (across all patients).
